Implement classification ensemble
    * change voting method
    * rework the 2d models
    * rework the 3d nn
    * add in the wavelet transform 2d models
    * add in wavelet transform 3d models
News
    * Try title and title/content from alpaca
    * use the vader model
    * use BERT model
Fundamentals
    * try out tiingo
    * make all of the days for a quarter have the relevant fundmental numbers
    * combine relevant fundamentals using principal component analysis or similar process
    * make longer term models only using fundamentals for longer time horizon
    * Bond rates, maybe putting precedence to 10 year rates
PCA
    * implement PCA option for data
    * implement other feature simplication techniques
Qlib
    * find out if any models there are relevant for project
MLENS
    * review results of the extensive MLENS testing for models worthy of further investigation
Data loading
    * structure data loading so all features can be modified with s or pc or d or wt
    * above looks like pc.o or pc.TSF or tick_SPY_pc.c
    * rename all of those old prediction files to prevent unncessary duplication
Model testing
    * all of these new data sources need to be retested: SPY, 7MA, AROON, time series forecast, ht_trendmode, ht_sine, pearson's correlation, money flow index, relative strength index, day_of_week, chaikin line, true range, volatility estimators, 10Y bond rate, differenced data
    * less patience for super complicated models like nn4
Tensorflow tuner
    * using build in tuner with a whole bunch of hyperparameters to see if it can find anything usefull
Model loading/trading 
    * start the load_run.py sooner than 3:58 on a timer
    * have all the models get loaded into memory ahead of time
    * load data exactly at 3:59 to make predictions/make trading decisions
