Implement classification ensemble
    * add in the wavelet transform 2d models
    * add in wavelet transform 3d models
News
    * Try title and title/content from alpaca
    * use finBERT model
Fundamentals
    * try out tiingo
    * make all of the days for a quarter have the relevant fundmental numbers
    * combine relevant fundamentals using principal component analysis or similar process
    * make longer term models only using fundamentals for longer time horizon
    * Bond rates, maybe putting precedence to 10 year rates
PCA
    * implement PCA option for data
    * implement other feature simplication techniques
Qlib
    * find out if any models there are relevant for project
MLENS
    * review results of the extensive MLENS testing for models worthy of further investigation
Model testing
    * all of these new data sources need to be retested: ht_sine, pearson's correlation, money flow index, relative strength index, day_of_week, chaikin line, true range, 10Y bond rate
    * classification NN ensembles
    * use the new volatility indicators
keras tuner
    * allow keras tuner to build model dynamically based on layers parameter
Model loading/trading 
    * start the load_run.py sooner than 3:58 on a timer
    * have all the models get loaded into memory ahead of time
    * load data exactly at 3:59 to make predictions/make trading decisions
